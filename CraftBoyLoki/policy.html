<h3>1. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES CRAFT BOY LOKI COLLECT?</h3>



<p>The personal information we may collect about you through the Services falls into the following general categories:</p>



<h4>1.1. Information that you provide voluntarily</h4>



<p>Certain parts of our Services may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily. For example, we may ask for certain information in order to register an account with us, to begin playing Games, to subscribe to marketing communications from us, and/or to submit enquiries to us, such as:</p>



<ul><li>your name, email address or other contact details</li><li>&nbsp;any information you submit to our customer service team in the Game or via email</li></ul>



<p>The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be explained to you when we ask you to provide your personal information.</p>



<h4>1.2 Information we collect automatically</h4>



<p>When you use our Services, we may also collect certain information automatically from you and/or your device which may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws, such as:</p>



<ul><li>Your Service communications (e.g. in-game chats and messages with other players)</li><li>Data and analytics about your use of our Services (e.g. in-game play progress, levels, games played, session length, preferred settings, which in-game adverts you may have viewed, in-game preferences or just game preferences, which friends you connect with, the means by which you were referred to our Services)</li><li>Your IP address and device identifiers such as your Advertising ID, Device ID numbers (for more see here “Advertising IDs and Device IDs”)</li><li>Your device type and the operating system that you use</li><li>General geographic location (e.g. country or city location) based on your IP address</li><li>GPS location, with your consent</li></ul>



<p>“<em>Advertising ID</em>” means the Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple, and Google Advertising Identity (“GAID”). These are unique identifiers for mobile devices that advertisers use for interest-based advertising. They are consistent across all apps and thus allow cross-app tracking. On Apple, you can opt out by choosing the “limit ad tracking” option in the privacy settings. On Google Android, you can opt out by choosing the “Opt out of interest based ads.” Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers uniquely associated with your device. Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads. These technologies allow companies (including marketers and advertisers) to recognize your device when you use websites and applications.<br><br></p>



<p><em>“Device identifier / information”</em>&nbsp;means device type, device model, device manufacturer, device operating system and language, or other technical data like screen size, processor, or a combination of this data, available from a device for a developer to check the device’s compatibility with a particular application.</p>



<p>Some of this information may be collected using cookies and/or similar technologies (such as ” software development kits, or “SDKs”)<br><br></p>



<h4>1.3 Information we obtain from third party sources</h4>



<p>(a)&nbsp;<span style="font-style: inherit;">Information from social media platforms.</span>&nbsp;You may choose to connect to our Services via your social media account. The exact information we receive from you will depend on your social media privacy settings, but it will typically include your basic public profile information, such as:</p>



<ul><li>your username</li><li>profile picture</li><li>age range</li><li>gender</li></ul>



<p>Typical uses include updating game progress on multiple devices you may own so that you can continue your progress using multiple devices. In addition, we may show your Facebook friends in the Game and show your public Facebook profile name and picture in Game leaderboards and in your Game profile.</p>



<p>(b)&nbsp;<span style="font-style: inherit;">Third party service providers.</span>&nbsp;We may receive personal information about you from third-party sources. We may get your personal information, for example, when you installed our Game or when, prior to installation, you click on an advertisement for the Game (see “Third Parties” section below for further detail).<br><br></p>



<p>(c)&nbsp;<span style="font-style: inherit;">Advertising partners.</span>&nbsp;From time to time, we may also receive personal information about you from other third-party sources. For example, if you clicked on an advertisement directing you to one of our Services (such as an ad for one of our Games in another publishers’ game), we will be provided with information about which ad network and advertising campaign the install originated from (See also “Advertising” below).<br><br></p>



<h4>1.4 No special categories of information</h4>



<p>We do not request or intend to collect any “special categories of information” such as any information on health, race, religion, political opinions or philosophical beliefs, sexual preferences or orientation. Please, be cautious when sharing this information about yourself (or others) in our forums.</p>

<p>3.1 We use advertising to fund our Services and to make our games available for free. We show third-party advertising in our Games and also advertise our Services via third parties. We want to provide you with more detail about how we use the information for advertising, both in our properties and in third-party properties.</p>



<p><u style="font-style: inherit;">When you view ads in CRAFT BOY LOKI properties(e.g. in our games)</u></p>



<p>3.2 To enable us to show in-game ads, we may send your advertising ID and IP address to advertisers (or ad networks) to enable them to find appropriate ads to serve to you in our Games and on third-party properties. You can control and limit our use of your advertising ID in your device settings. <u style="font-style: inherit;">CRAFT BOY LOKI </u>does not control which specific ads are shown in our games (this is controlled by ad networks), but we do prohibit certain types of ads.</p>



<p>3.3.&nbsp;Advertising IDs&nbsp;are used by ad networks for a number of purposes (please refer to the Privacy Notices of our advertising partners listed herein as “<span style="font-style: inherit;">Third Parties</span>“) including, for example, to:</p>



<p>(a) limit the number of times you see the same ad</p>



<p>(b) ensure they are dealing with humans with real devices and not automated “bots”</p>



<p>(c) to serve you with advertisements likely to be relevant to you based on your advertising ID, your engagement with other brands and ads which is recorded using your advertising ID, and to use your general geographic area.</p>



<p>(d) Other brands buy ad placements via an ad network or ad exchange to advertise their products in <u style="font-style: inherit;">CRAFT BOY LOKI </u>Games. The ad network or ad exchange acts as intermediary between the other game companies and Dmobi. In order for an ad network to charge the company purchasing the ad, clicks from the ad and potential installs of other developers’ apps are tracked. Views, clicks and installs from ads are measured using the Advertising ID.</p>



<p>(e) Ad networks track which games you have used to market you similar kind of games.</p>



<p>Your IP address is typically used by advertisers to identify your general geographic location, for example, your country, state and, sometimes, your city).</p>

<p>3.4 <u style="font-style: inherit;">CRAFT BOY LOKI </u>also advertises its games on other apps by asking ad networks to place ads for audiences that will be interested in them (determined using Advertising IDs).</p>



<p>3.5 Ad networks use Advertising IDs for this and other purposes (please refer to the Privacy Notices of our advertising partners listed as “Third Parties”) including, for example, to:</p>



<p>(a) Measure ad effectiveness (looking at total views, clicks and installs generated by its advertising in other publishers’ games);</p>



<p>(b) Inform players that have not played for a while about new content in the Game. <u style="font-style: inherit;">CRAFT BOY LOKI </u>gives a list of these users in the form of Advertising IDs to an ad network. The ad network then shows these users ads about the new content.</p>



<p>(c) Not display ads for a game a player is already playing. <u style="font-style: inherit;">CRAFT BOY LOKI </u>may send a list of active players in the form of Advertising IDs to an ad network. The ad network then excludes these players from seeing the ad.</p>



<p>(d) Market games to a group of potential players. <u style="font-style: inherit;">CRAFT BOY LOKI </u>provides Facebook a list of Advertising IDs to match them with similar type of Facebook users to whom <u style="font-style: inherit;">CRAFT BOY LOKI </u>could then market its games. <u style="font-style: inherit;">CRAFT BOY LOKI </u>does not have information on how Facebook identifies or creates profiles of similar type of users.</p>

Specific measures include encrypting your personal information in transit and at rest.</p>



<h3>8. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h3>



<p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country of which you are a resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country.</p>



<p>Specifically, our Game servers are currently located in the United States, and our business group members, third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries. However, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place so that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. This includes complying with the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information among companies in our business group and third-party service providers and partners, which require all members of our business group to protect the personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law. It also includes the transfer of personal information to third-party service providers and partners that are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.</p>



<p>The Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided on request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers, and partners and further details can be provided upon request.</p>



<h3>9. DATA RETENTION</h3>



<p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so. For example, to provide you with a Service you have requested, or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements. For example, we periodically de-identify unused Game accounts and regularly review and de-identify unnecessary personal information.</p>



<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or de-identify it, or, if this is not possible – for example, because your personal information has been stored on a backup server – then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

<p>(a) To&nbsp;<span style="font-style: inherit;">access, correct, update or request deletion</span>&nbsp;of your personal information. You may do so in your account settings (via “<em>Terms of Service and Privacy Notice</em>“)&nbsp;</p>

<p>(d) If we are processing your personal information with your consent, you can&nbsp;<span style="font-style: inherit;">withdraw your consent</span>&nbsp;at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted pursuant to lawful processing grounds other than consent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(e) You have the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: inherit;">right to file a complaint with a data protection authority</span>&nbsp;about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.</p>
