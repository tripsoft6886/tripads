Google uses Google Analytics cookies (first-party cookies), which are stored for up to two years, to analyse the use of the website and the apps. The information collected using cookies (including IP addresses) is generally transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the USA. Nolan Studio uses Google Analytics with the „_anonymizehelp()“ extension, whereby all IP addresses are anonymised within the EU before transmission to the USA takes place, so that there is no longer any direct personal reference regarding the transmission and evaluation of the data. On behalf of Nolan Studio, Google analyses the website and app activities of the users and summarises the results in reports for Nolan Studio. This information may be transferred by Google to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Cookies are only placed with the consent of the user if legally required (Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a) GDPR).

          <p>The <span class="text-darkblue">Nolan Studio</span> website uses the online marketing tool Campaign Manager by Google (inter alia Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland and Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). Campaign Manager uses cookies to serve ads relevant to users, to improve campaign performance reports, or to prevent a user from seeing the same ads more than once. Google uses a cookie ID to track which ads appear in which browser, thereby preventing them from appearing more than once. In addition, Campaign Manager can use cookie IDs to collect conversions related to ad requests. This is the case, for example, when a user sees a Campaign Manager ad and later visits the advertiser’s website with the same browser and buys something there. Because of the marketing tools used, your browser automatically connects directly to Google’s server. We have no influence on the extent and further use of the data collected by Google through the use of this tool and therefore inform you according to our state of knowledge: Through the integration of Campaign Manager, Google receives the information that you have called the relevant part of our website or clicked on an advertisement from us. If you are registered with a Google service, Google can assign the visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, it is possible for the provider to find out and store your IP address. Cookies are only placed with the consent of the user if legally required (Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a) GDPR). Data processing may also be based on Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f) GDPR or TMG with our legitimate interest of marketing and quality assurance.</p>

            <p>OPT-OUT: There are a number of ways in which you can prevent Google from participating in this tracking process: by setting your browser software accordingly, disable third-party cookies to prevent you from receiving advertisements from third parties; by deactivating cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain www.googleadservices.com, <a href="https://www.google.de/settings/ads" class="text-blue">www.google.de/settings/ads</a>, whereby this setting is deleted when you delete your cookies; by disabling the interest-based ads of the providers that are part of the ‘About Ads’ self-regulatory campaign via the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" class="text-blue">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> link, whereby this setting is deleted when you delete your cookies; by permanently disabling it in your browser via the <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin" class="text-blue">www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin</a> link; by setting the appropriate cookies setting. We would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this offer to their full extent.
