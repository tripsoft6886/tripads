<div class="content"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Craft Pixelart Forrest City LLC Privacy Policy</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reserve the right to change this policy from time to time, so be sure to check it periodically.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Information</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All personal details that you provide to our website and/or applications are absolutely safe, private, and secure. We respect the importance of information security and confidentiality, and do not disclose them to outside sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not share your information with any third parties, with the exception of verified and secure e-commerce payment providers. When placing orders, our e-commerce provider handles your personal information and keeps it absolutely safe and secure—in fact, even we cannot access your credit card information. Your personal information (excluding credit card data) is shared with us only for administration purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can always choose not to provide your personal details, though they might be needed to make a purchase or take advantage of  some of our app’s specific features.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information Collection and Use</span></h3>

We may collect the following information from our users:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First name, last name, email address, billing address, and phone number</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For processing transactions, we also collect either credit card information or bank information, depending on your form of payment, though we do not store any credit card information once your transaction is complete</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also collect Non-Personal Information, a term that refers to data that does not identify you. Such information can be related to the Games (including but not limited to your in-game score, how long you’ve been playing, and your in-game activities) or to the general use (including but not limited to internet protocol addresses, browser types, browser languages, referring and exit URLs, and number of clicks).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reserve the right to use all content generated by our users. By such content, we mean all content that users publish through the game and that is visible to other users (including but not limited to wall posts, sent messages, and other kinds of interaction with other players). Please note that Craft Pixelart Forrest City does not guarantee the protection of any Personal Information posted in comments and/or on user walls. With that in mind, please double-check information before publishing it in the public domain. We are in no way responsible for how that information is used by other parties.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may use your Personal Information to contact you as needed, including but not limited to by sending you notifications. If you do not want to receive further notifications from us, you can always disable this option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event that local law requires, and/or if we believe it will help avoid liability or fraud, and/or to comply with legal processes, we may disclose or access information about you, including but not limited to sharing information with the government and other companies. Craft Pixelart Forrest City does not have to and will not question governmental requests and processes.</span></p>
