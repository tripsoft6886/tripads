To do so they use personal and non-personal information such as advertising identifiers i.e. the Android advertising ID and/or Apple's ID for advertising (IDFA), device data and/or other tracking technologies to enable and optimize this advertising procedure.</p>
<p>You can opt-out from personalized advertisement experience, at any time by checking the Privacy Setting tab in any of our apps or under the privacy settings of your iOS or Android device.</p>
<h5>Method 1 (depending on your local privacy laws) - App Settings:</h5>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you choose to opt-out, advertising networks will consider this choice as a withdrawal of consent to personalized advertisement experience and they will show contextual advertisements and not personalized advertisements based on your interests.</p>
<p>Note: Irrespective of your choice and/or your device settings, you will continue to see non-customized advertising (e.g. “contextual” advertising) and you may continue to receive personalized ads from our third-party ad networks that obtain your consent on other apps and/or websites.
