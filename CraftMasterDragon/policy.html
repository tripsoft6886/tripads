<p><strong>4. How Craft Master Dragon Works</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is how Craft Master Dragon works:</strong><br>
<strong>An user ID is created automatically for a new user. A virtual character is generated to represent his or her identity in the Craft Master Dragon.</strong><br>
<strong>Users interact with other users through in-game, personal messaging, and other similar features. Users can remove friends or delete account to restrict or disable communications with other users.</strong><br>
<strong>Each user is given one or more pieces of virtual real space on which they can unlock items and characters, ripe golden fruit, trade in the game and accelerate the growth of their gardens.</strong><br>
<strong>Users search for, find, and play games made by other users. They play these games with other users around the world, and are identified only by their user ID.</strong><br>
<strong>The Craft Master Dragon includes virtual currency known as Mini Coins and Mini Beans, 1 Mini Coins=60 Mini Beans; users can purchase Mini coins and Mini Beans in a variety of ways, and use them to buy items for their characters, for in-game items, and other uses.</strong><br>
<strong>For more information on how our service works, please see our Terms of Service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Setting Up an Account on Craft Master Dragon</strong></p>
<p><strong>Users are given an UID when they first enter the game. Then he or she can name the character. Users may be asked to provide some demographic information such as your age or date of birth, gender, country or language preference (so we can customize your experience on Craft Master Dragon).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Users should not create an username that reflects their own name or other personal data. Users should also not pick a password that is easy to guess, and should not share their password. For security reasons, we store passwords in encrypted form.</strong></p>
<p><strong>UIDs are used for participating in Service features and we do not use them to identify individual users outside our Service. UIDs are not shared with third-party companies except for the third-party companies who use or process the UIDs for purposes of helping operate our Service, such as effectuating payments.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Users may be asked to provide or may choose to add an email address or bind to the Facebook account for added verification and/or to enable certain features. The primary purpose for this is to provide account security, as this is the only way for Master Dragon to check the authenticity of an account owner. In this circumstance, users under the age of 13 are asked to provide a parent email address. Users may change the email address associated with their account at any time; however, a notification will be sent to the previously provided email address upon making that change.</strong></p>
