<p>3.   WHY WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</p>
<p>a)   To provide our Games to you<br>
We will use information about you (including Basic Information, Third Party Log In Information, Analytics and User Content) for delivering our Games to you under the terms of use agreed between us. The processing of information in this way is necessary for us to record your progress and current status within a Game, and to ensure the Games deliver the features promised and function properly, so that you have the best experience when playing any one of our Games.</p>
<p>b)   To help us improve the Online Services and fix any problems<br>
We may process information about you (including Basic Information, User Content and Analytics) so that we can analyse and improve our Games and Online Services.<br>
This processing is also necessary for us to pursue our legitimate interests of (i) ensuring that our Online Services function properly so that you and other users have the best experience when playing any of our Game(s) and using the other Online Services; (ii) improving the quality of our Online Services, and providing a better experience to our users; (iii) identifying and correcting any bugs in the Games and Online Services and iv) understanding the effectiveness of our marketing to attract new users and re-engage our current users at an aggregated level.</p>
<p>d)   To acquire new users and engage current users<br>
We may process information (including some Advertising Data and Analytics) to encourage engagement from our less active users and to notify them with new virtual items or other promotions on offer.<br>
We may also process this information to pursue our legitimate interests of acquiring new users for our Games.<br>
We use various forms of marketing to acquire new users. The information we collect about you may be used to improve the relevancy of our marketing, including the creation of ‘lookalike’ audiences. This allows us to offer more relevant marketing to potential new service users without using information that personally identifies you.</p>
<p>e)   To improve the monetisation of the Games via in-app purchases<br>
We may process information (including Basic Information, User Content, Advertising Data and Analytics) to understand how users use our Games, and to compile statistical reports regarding that activity, as well as understanding how users progress, and their current status within a Game. This processing is necessary for us to pursue our legitimate interests of improving the Games and increasing the amount of revenue generated via in-app purchases. This may include the implementation of dynamic pricing models, so that in-app purchases are priced according to relevant factors, such as geography and gameplay progression so that we can offer temporary promotional discounts.</p>
<p>f)   For advertising purposes<br>
We may process Advertising Data to show you advertisements for third party services; including advertising that may reward you with benefits during your use of the Games.<br>
The information we collect about you may be used to understand how advertisements placed in our Games have performed or how many people have viewed certain advertisements. We aggregate this information so that it does not personally identify you or permit you to be treated individually.<br>
We may also use this information to reward users with benefits that can be used for further enjoyment of the Games from the viewing of certain advertising placed in our Games.<br>
We will not pass or process your information for the purposes of marketing by third parties unless you give your consent should we ask for it. After you have given your consent, you may withdraw it at any time.<br>
We may use the information we collect about you to serve you targeted advertisements in our Games. We do this to provide you with more relevant advertising content. We work with the following third party advertising networks :<br>

However, this is on the basis that they do not make independent use of the information, and have agreed to safeguard it.<br>
Merger or acquisition: If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, any third party to which we sell or transfer our assets to will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.<br>

<p>5.   AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING<br>
We may use automated decision making methods which do not involve human involvement to process your information only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy<br>
We may process your personal information via automated decision making methods in order to identify users who are suspected of cheating in the Games. Our automated decision making methods are designed to detect cheating by looking out for (i) excessive currency stores against actual completed gameplay; and (ii) excessive content against actual purchases made and completed gameplay.<br>
If users are determined to be or suspected of cheating the following actions may be taken and which will be unknown to the user:<br>
•   an increase in the number of advertisements displayed within the Games; and<br>
•   an increase in the frequency of suspected cheats playing against other suspected cheats.<br>
We may block users from the Games and/or the Online Services who are determined to be cheating following an automated decision process. In this scenario the user will be notified of the outcome and will have the right to obtain human intervention to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision to block access to the Games and/or the Online Services.</p>
<p>6.   CONSUMER CONTROL AND OPT-OUT OPTIONS<br>
If you do not wish to be part of a lookalike campaign, receive notifications from us or be served with targeted advertisements you can opt-out by changing your advertising and notification settings on your device directly.<br>
You can withdraw your consent to targeted advertising by changing your advertising settings on your device at any time.</p>
