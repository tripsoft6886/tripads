            <h4>6. AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING</h4>
            <p><strong></strong></p><center><strong>We use automated decision making methods which do not involve human involvement to process your information only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy</strong></center><p></p>
            <p>We process your personal information via automated decision making methods in order to identify users who are suspected of cheating in the Games. Our automated decision making methods are designed to detect cheating by looking out for (i) excessive currency stores against actual completed gameplay; and (ii) excessive content against actual purchases made and completed gameplay.</p>
            <p>If users are determined to be or suspected of cheating the following actions may be taken and which will be unknown to the user:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>an increase in the number of advertisements displayed within the Games; and</li>
              <li>an increase in the frequency of suspected cheats playing against other suspected cheats.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may block users from the Games and/or the Online Services who are determined to be cheating following an automated decision process. In this scenario the user will be notified of the outcome and will have the right to obtain human intervention to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision to block access to the Games and/or the Online Services.</p>
